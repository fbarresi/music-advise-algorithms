abstract = {With the progress of technology in music players, especially in intelligent cell phones, users have access to large archives. Quick and easy selecting favorite music among these large archives becomes one of the biggest problems for users. For example, selecting music in a silent forest is different from a crowded street or feelings for listening to music in a morning of a working day is different from an afternoon of a holiday. In this paper, a system has been designed that it collects users' context information such as weather, temperature, geographical position, etc., and according to a weighted combination of them, it recommends an appropriate music that is a user's favorite at the moment. Thus, this system includes a rating method that determines how close are music's context, which have been played before, in the moment's context and recommend the music that has the most closeness. The result of this research shows that recommendations that this system makes in different conditions, is closed to the user's choice.},

abstract = {With the growth of digital music, the development of music recommendation is helpful for users to pick desirable music pieces from a huge repository of music. The existing music recommendation approaches are based on a user's preference on music. However, sometimes, it might better meet users' requirement to recommend music pieces according to emotions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for emotion-based music recommendation. The core of the recommendation framework is the construction of the music emotion model by affinity discovery from film music, which plays an important role in conveying emotions in film. We investigate the music feature extraction and propose the Music Affinity Graph and Music Affinity Graph-Plus algorithms for the construction of music emotion model. Experimental result shows the proposed emotion-based music recommendation achieves 85{\%} accuracy in average. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A large number of people download music files easily from web sites. But rare music sites provide personalized services. So, we suggest a method for personalized services. We extract the properties of music from music's sound wave. We use STFT (Shortest Time Fourier Form) to analyze music's property. And we infer users' preferences from users' music list. To analyze users' preferences we propose a dynamic K-means clustering algorithm. The dynamic K-means clustering algorithm clusters the pieces in the music list dynamically adapting the number of clusters. We recommend pieces of music based on the clusters. The previous recommendation systems analyze a user's preference by simply averaging the properties of music in the user's list. So those cannot recommend correctly if a user prefers several genres of music. By using our K-means clustering algorithm, we can recommend pieces of music which are close to user's preference even though he likes several genres. We perform experiments with one hundred pieces of music. In this paper we present and evaluate algorithms to recommend music. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {In recent years, with the development and application of big data, deep learning has received more and more attention. As a deep learning neural network, convolutional neural network plays an extremely important role in face image recognition. In this paper, a combination of micro-expression recognition technology of convolutional neural network and automatic music recommendation algorithm is developed to identify a model that recognizes facial micro-expressions and recommends music according to corresponding mood. The facial micro-expression recognition model established in this paper uses FER2013 with a recognition rate of 62.1{\%}. After identifying the corresponding expression, a content-based music recommendation algorithm is used to extract the feature vector of the song and a cosine similarity algorithm is used to make the music recommendation. This research helps to improve the practicality of the music recommendation system, and the related results will also serve as a reference for the application of the music recommendation system in areas such as emotion regulation.},

abstract = {There are various kinds of social media information, including different types of objects and relations among these objects, in music social communities such as Last.fm and Pandora. This information is valuable for music recommendation. However, there are two main challenges to exploit this rich social media information: (a) There are many different types of objects and relations in music social communities, which makes it difficult to develop a unified framework taking into account all objects and relations. (b) In these communities, some relations are much more sophisticated than pairwise relation, and thus cannot be simply modeled by a graph. We propose a novel music recommendation algorithm by using both multiple kinds of social media information and music acoustic-based content. Instead of graph, we use hypergraph to model the various objects and relations, and consider music recommendation as a ranking problem on this hypergraph. While an edge of an ordinary graph connects only two objects, a hyperedge represents a set of objects. In this way, hypergraph can be naturally used to model high-order relations. {\textcopyright} 2011 ACM.},
